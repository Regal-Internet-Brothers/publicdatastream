publicdatastream
================

**ATTENTION:** This module location has been *"deprecated"*. This repository is no longer a part of the official "modules" repository, as it has been superseded by '[ioutil](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/ioutil)'. **For a standalone/compatibility version, visit [the "standalone" branch](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/publicdatastream/tree/standalone)**. The main branch now acts as an "import proxy" to 'ioutil.publicdatastream'.

**ORIGINAL README**:

The 'publicdatastream' module is a re-implementation of the 'brl.datastream' module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey), which delegates several components. This module was originally built for use with the ['regalnet' module](https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet/regalnet). Compatibility has since been "officially broken". For a compatible version, see the ["regalnet" branch](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/publicdatastream/tree/regalnet). RegalNET is now no longer officially supported.
