publicdatastream
================

The 'publicdatastream' module is a re-implementation of the 'brl.datastream' module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey) which delegates the internal data-buffer. This module is mainly used by [my 'RegalNET' module](https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet/regalnet).
