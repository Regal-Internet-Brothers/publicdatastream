publicdatastream
================

**ATTENTION**: This module has been moved into the '[ioutil](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/ioutil)' as a sub-module. This branch ("standalone") exists for backward compatibility. Please migrate existing code to the 'ioutil' module's 'publicdatastream' sub-module.

The 'publicdatastream' module is a re-implementation of the 'brl.datastream' module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey), which delegates several components. This module was originally built for use with the ['regalnet' module](https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet/regalnet). Compatibility has since been "officially broken". For a compatible version, see the ["regalnet" branch](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/publicdatastream/tree/regalnet). RegalNET is now no longer officially supported.
