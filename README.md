publicdatastream
================

The 'publicdatastream' module is a re-implementation of the 'brl.datastream' module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey), which delegates the several components. This module was originally built for use with the ['regalnet' module](https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet/regalnet). Compatibility has since been "officially broken". For a compatible version, see the "regalnet" branch. RegalNET is now no longer officially supported.
